## Description
Wow, great work finding that C2 traffic! I know this might not be strictly legal, but I think we should put our gray hats on and see what we can figure out about that C2 server. I have no idea what that WCS{} data we got back means...

See if you can get that C2 server to send you a meaningful response in the same format. We'll send whatever data you get over to our analysts.
