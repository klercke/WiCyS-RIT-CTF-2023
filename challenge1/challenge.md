## Description
One of our employees, Chris Hall, has been exceptionally unproductive lately and we have been getting alerts regarding strange activity from their workstation. We believe that, in the process of downloading pirated games onto their work computer, Chris installed some malware. The computer was unfortunately wiped before we could get our hands on it, but we do have this pcap captured from their computer before it was wiped. We've looked through it and can't find anything malicious, but the SOC swears there has to some sort of command & control traffic in here. 

See if you can make any sense of it and let me know what you find.
